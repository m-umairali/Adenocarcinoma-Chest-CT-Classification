Our project focuses on developing an advanced image classification solution for efficiently detecting adenocarcinoma cancer from chest CT scans. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, our model aims to accurately differentiate between scans showing signs of adenocarcinoma and those that are cancer-free.

## Dataset:
We utilize a comprehensive dataset of chest CT scans, annotated by medical professionals to indicate the presence or absence of adenocarcinoma cancer. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure diversity and representativeness, enabling robust model training and evaluation.

## Usage:
- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the chest CT scans to prepare them for input into the classification model.
- Model Training: Train the classification model using the preprocessed data and appropriate machine learning techniques.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using validation datasets and appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-world usage, integrating it into existing medical imaging systems or workflows.
